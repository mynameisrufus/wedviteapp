# Wording Example

    This is an example invitation. The # before a sentence means "make 
    this a large heading" and ## means "make this a not so large 
    heading" and ###, well you get the picture. They will look different 
    depending on what invitation you choose.

    The double squigly lines around 'guest.name' means your are putting in some
    dynamic content. You only need this for the guests name otherwise the
    invitation will not be personalised. Make sure it is formatted
    exactly as bellow.

    Make sure you preview your invitation to make sure it's how you want it.
